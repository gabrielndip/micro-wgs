## Purpose
Add a clinical microbiology–focused project portfolio and link it from the README. The portfolio presents the WGS pipeline (QC → trimming → assembly → MLST → optional alignment/variants) with clinical acceptance criteria, AMR relevance, governance, and validation considerations.

## Changes
- docs: new `portfolio_bacterial_wgs_pipeline.md` (clinical-facing portfolio)
- docs: `README.md` updated with a link to the portfolio

## How to Reproduce
- Open `portfolio_bacterial_wgs_pipeline.md` to review the clinical summary.
- The portfolio references generated artifacts under `results/` (e.g., MultiQC, coverage, MLST, VCF stats). To regenerate, run:
  - `mamba env create -f envs/snakemake.yml && mamba activate snake`
  - `snakemake --use-conda --cores 4`

## Expected Outputs (paths)
- QC: `results/qc/fastqc/*`, `results/qc/fastp/*`, `results/qc/fastqc_trimmed/*`
- Assembly: `results/assembly/sample/contigs.fasta`
- MLST: `results/mlst/sample_mlst.tsv`
- Alignment/Variants (optional): `results/aln/sample.sorted.bam`, `results/variants/sample.filtered.vcf.gz`
- Reports: `results/reports/multiqc_report.html`, `results/reports/coverage.txt`, `results/reports/vcf_stats.txt`, `results/reports/variants_summary.tsv`, `results/reports/versions.txt`

## Clinical Notes
- Highlights acceptance criteria examples (mapping rate, properly paired %, depth), governance/auditability, curated AMR panel guidance, and validation/verification next steps.
- No PHI/PII or raw data are exposed; portfolio references file paths only.

## Checklist
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Portfolio added and linked
- [x] No workflow logic changes
